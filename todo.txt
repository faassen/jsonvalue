* do we also need a dump per node type context to do expansion? Answer:
  since we supply the context ourselves, probably not.

* describe exceptions that can happen in docs.

* API docs.

* morepath integration.

* what is the right behavior for a type that we don't have a
  loader/dumper for? Right now I think we pass them through literally,
  but if you want to do true validation you cannot do this, right?
  What about when type is missing?
