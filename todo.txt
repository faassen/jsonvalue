* do we also need a dump per node type context to do expansion? Answer:
  since we supply the context ourselves, probably not.

* errors for loading and dumping nodes too, instead of values. How to
  deal with error handling here? Always fail if load/dump function errors?

* should we have an load error where a value described in the context
  is required, i.e. if it is missing/None then it's an error?

* describe exceptions that can happen in docs.

* API docs.

* morepath integration.

* what is the right behavior for a type that we don't have a
  loader/dumper for? Right now I think we pass them through literally,
  but if you want to do true validation you cannot do this, right?
  What about when type is missing? Node type versus value type?
