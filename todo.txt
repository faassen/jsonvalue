* internal per-data type context versus user-supplied context.

* describe exceptions that can happen.

* morepath integration.

* error message: conversion error for while input conversion, with sub-errors
  per field.

  loader/dumper for? Right now I think we pass them through literally,
  but if you want to do true validation you cannot do this, right?
  What about when type is missing?
